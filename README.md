# CodeBook-Data-Structure-And-Algorithm-Java

This repository contains my solutions and approaches for practicing data structures and algorithms using Java, as well as for solving problems on LeetCode.

## Purpose
- To practice various data structures and algorithms using Java.
- To solve problems on LeetCode and document both my solutions and the problem codes for testing my solutions.
- To utilize this repository as a personal codebook for future reference.

## Structure
- Folders are organized based on the difficulty levels of LeetCode problems, and each problem's name is used for Java class files. The data structures and algorithms used are documented in the Update Summary.

## Contact
- For any questions or suggestions, please contact jindokim.kor@gmail.com.
